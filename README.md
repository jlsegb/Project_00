Project 00

Due Monday: 6pm

Team Members: Jose Luis Segura Burgos
**No other team members worked with me, so I did this own my own"
Comments: I learned a lot about lisp, this was kind of over-kill for one person since I didn't get much of the 
lisp functions done(I didn't get the mapcar).
I Got most excercises. This would have been better in a group (I acknowledge I chose to do it on my own).
Time spent: 9 hours

It was definitely a problem solving project rather than excercise solving. **I think my paragraph was clever, 
so you should read it!**
